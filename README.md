# SpamDaDiscord
A program that lets you spam a message to your friends!

**Warning!** You need the `pyautogui` library to use this script.

You can enter a message to spam your friends and how many times to send it. (below 20 times)
And then you have to focus onto Discord and click the textbox. Then you just wait!
Then it will send your messages!

**Another Warning!** Your friends will hate you, and you might get banned or warned on servers.
